Hi there, how are you keeping?

I've been working at McDonalds for 3 months. There are several shifts that you can do. From 7:00 to 15:00, for instance. Nevertheless, recently I've been on close too many times. McDonalds pays you a taxi if you want to, in order to come back home (after closing). 1 month ago we, as employers, suffered from cutting down our hours, it was supposed to be because they were broke at some point. Renting in Dublin is crazy. I wasn't able to get by working too few hours. That's why you are reading my code. I came up with that idea last time I took a taxi, maybe yesterday. 

I got confused the first time I took a taxi, since I really didn't even know where I lived. So I failed when I put my address on Uber. This ride was 17â‚¬. After sorting this problem out (my address), I pay between 12 and 14 euro. I must send a screenshot of the taxi to the manager by email, and afterwards they give me the money back.

What you have in front of you here is a software which can be improved by you so as to get some extra euro from your fucking company, whatever it is.
